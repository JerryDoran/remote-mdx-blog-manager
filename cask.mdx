# Cask

To install cask at the terminal type

`brew install cask`

To get help or additional information about a utility you want to install on your mac type:

`brew cask help`

To search for a list of casks to install type:

`brew search --casks`

This will display a list with hundreds of casks(applications) that are available to install on your mac. For example I can search for a cask called **_'discord'_** from the list by typing:

`brew search discord`

If I want to install discord I can type:

`brew cask install discord`

This will download this package and install it on my machine. I can then open spotlight by pressing **_cmd + spacebar_** and search for 'discord' and it will appear in a list.

To update every application that is installed by using cask I can type:

`brew cask upgrade`
